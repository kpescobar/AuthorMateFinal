This app is a tool for writers to set writing goals for themselves.
At this stage in development the app reads/writes to the database and displays to the user the following statistics:
1. Word count goal
2. Deadline
3. Words Written
4. Words Remaining
5. Advised Daily Goal

The user is able to create new projects and view them in the navigation bar. From there the user can select desired project
and update it's word count directly.

The notification system has not been fully integrated.

The following changes need to be made to the app:
2. Cannot navigate back to "home" page once a project is selected.

The next steps for this app, to be finished by graduation, will be to make the notifications fully functional and to make the date
on the project creation page a calendar picker as well as fix the two issues mentioned above.

For demo day I plan to change the view of the statistics on the project page to reflect if their deadline has passed/if they have met their
word count goal. I will also tweak the layout and look of each page for an aesthetically pleasing application.
